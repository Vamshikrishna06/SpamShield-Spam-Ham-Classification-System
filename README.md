# SpamShield – Spam & Ham Classification System

## Overview

**SpamShield** is a machine learning–based text classification project designed to automatically identify whether a message is **Spam** or **Ham (Not Spam)**. The system uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and classification algorithms to analyze text messages and accurately detect unwanted spam communications.

## Features

* Automatic classification of messages into Spam or Ham
* Text preprocessing using tokenization, stopword removal, and vectorization
* Machine learning model training and evaluation
* Accuracy and performance metric visualization
* Easy-to-use prediction interface for testing new messages

## Technologies Used

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Libraries:** Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, NLTK / NLP tools
* **Model:** Naive Bayes / Logistic Regression (update as applicable)

## Usage

1. Load the dataset containing labeled messages.
2. Train the classification model using preprocessing and feature extraction.
3. Evaluate model performance using accuracy and confusion matrix.
4. Use the trained model to predict whether new messages are Spam or Ham.

## Applications

* Email and SMS spam filtering
* Fraud and phishing message detection
* Automated message monitoring systems
